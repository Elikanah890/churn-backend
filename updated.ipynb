    "### Group Members#ANSWERS\n",
    "1. Handling Missing Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "For handling missing values in the Telco dataset, especially in the columns like \"Monthly Charges\" and \"Total Charges\", imputation techniques such as mean, median, or mode are commonly used. For \"Monthly Charges\" and \"Total Charges\", imputation with the median or mean can work well. The median is particularly useful if the distribution is skewed, while the mean might be more appropriate if the data is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively handling missing values is essential because features like \"Monthly Charges\" and \"Total Charges\" are key predictors of customer churn. Proper imputation ensures valuable data is retained, allowing the model to leverage all available information. Failing to address missing values can lead to biased predictions and decreased model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers in \"Monthly Charges\" or \"Total Charges\" might be genuine (such as high-paying customers) or due to errors. Instead of removing them without investigation, it’s best to first analyze whether the outliers are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they represent valid customer behavior, they should be kept as they could provide valuable insights for predicting churn. However, if the outliers are errors or do not contribute meaningfully to the prediction, they should be removed or corrected. This approach ensures that we maintain valuable data while improving the model’s accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Categorical Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "For features like \"Contract\", \"Internet Service\", and \"Phone Service\", we need to convert these categorical variables into numerical values that the machine learning model can interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "For ordinal categorical variables (where the values have a meaningful order), such as \"Contract\" with values like \"Month-to-Month\", \"One Year\", and \"Two Year\", label encoding can be used. Each category would be assigned an integer (e.g., \"Month-to-Month\" = 0, \"One Year\" = 1, \"Two Year\" = 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding:\n",
    "For nominal categorical variables (where there is no meaningful order), such as \"Internet Service\" or \"Phone Service\", one-hot encoding should be used. This creates a binary column for each category (e.g., for \"Internet Service\", there would be columns for \"Fiber Optic\" and \"DSL\", and the values would be 0 or 1 depending on the customer’s service type).\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper encoding ensures the machine learning model understands the relationship between categorical variables and the target variable (churn). This transformation allows the model to work effectively with non-numerical data, making it possible to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Handling the Tenure Column:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binning and Mapping:\n",
    "We transformed the \"Tenure\" feature into categories using binning. We divided the tenure into four categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Short\" (0–12 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Medium\" (13–24 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Long\" (25–36 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Very Long\" (36+ months)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each category was then mapped to a numerical value:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Short\" = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Medium\" = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Long\" = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Very Long\" = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we dropped the original \"Tenure\" and \"TenureCategory\" columns, leaving only the transformed numeric version for use in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binning and mapping \"Tenure\" into categories allows the model to capture patterns related to customer loyalty more effectively. It simplifies the data, making it easier for the model to identify trends, and prevents the model from being impacted by extreme tenure values. This transformation also improves interpretability by converting the feature into meaningful categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "We would have combined the service information (like \"Speed\" and \"Data Allowance\") with the Telco dataset by matching them using a shared column called \"CustomerID\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After combining the data, we would have fixed the missing details for some customers. For \"Speed\", we would have filled the gaps with the most common value (mode). For \"Data Allowance\", we would have used the average (mean) to fill the gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would have also added a new column called \"ServiceInfoMissing\" to mark customers with missing details. If a customer was missing data, this column would have shown a value of 1; otherwise, it would have shown 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the service information would have improved the dataset for predicting which customers might leave (churn). Fixing and marking missing details would have kept the data accurate and reliable for the prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Example for the Above\n",
    "# Merging datasets on CustomerID\n",
    "combined_data = pd.merge(data, service_data, on='CustomerID', how='left')\n",
    "\n",
    "# 'service_data' is the data we originally have\n",
    "# service_data is the additional data with service information\n",

    "# Impute missing values\n",
    "combined_data['Speed'].fillna(combined_data['Speed'].mode()[0], inplace=True)\n",
    "combined_data['Data Allowance'].fillna(combined_data['Data Allowance'].mean(), inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flag missing data\n",
    "combined_data['ServiceInfoMissing'] = combined_data[['Speed', 'Data Allowance']].isnull().any(axis=1).astype(int)\n",

    "    3\n",
    "NameError: name 'service_data' is not defined\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "For feature selection, we used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify and remove irrelevant features from the Telco dataset. RFE helps select the most important features by recursively removing the least important ones based on model performance. By applying RFE, we eliminated features like \"CustomerID\" that are not useful for churn prediction, improving model efficiency and focusing on the most relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Data Imbalance:\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated, customer churn is a relatively rare event compared to non-churn, which can lead to class imbalance in the dataset. This imbalance may cause the model to be biased toward predicting the majority class (non-churn), potentially reducing the model’s ability to identify churned customers accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we applied SMOTEENN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique + Edited Nearest Neighbors). SMOTEENN is an effective technique for handling class imbalance because it works by generating synthetic samples for the minority class (churn) while removing noise from the dataset using Edited Nearest Neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps balance the dataset by generating samples for churned customers, which improves the model’s ability to predict both churn and non-churn instances accurately.\n",
